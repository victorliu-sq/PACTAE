- At least **24 GB** of both host memory and GPU memory.
- At least **120 GB** of free disk space for storing generated synthetic data.

## Software Requirements

Please ensure your system meets the following minimum software versions (greater than or equal to these values):

- bash
- wget or curl
- perf
- ncu
- CUDA: 12.6
- GCC: 11.4.0

## Setup & Execution

To run BambooSMP, simply execute the following from the project root directory:

```bash
./runme.sh
```

The script will automatically handle dependencies downloads (requires wget or curl), installation, compilation, and
execution of workloads. The resulting `figure3`, `figure5`, `table1`, `figure7`, `figure8`, and `figure9` will be stored
in the `data/figures` directory. The entire experiment may take approximately 4â€“6 hours to complete, depending on the hardware configuration.
